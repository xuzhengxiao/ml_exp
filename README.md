# preparation
* read introduction and data description carefully.
* find and learn from similar competition's solution.
* keep tracing up-to-date development in this area and reading releated papers.
* **analysize data and build a stable cross-validation dataset.**
* data proprocessing,feature engineering and model training
* **analysize results,such as prediction distribution,error analysis and specific sample analysis.**
* refine model or design new moedl according analysis result.
* emsemble
* return to beginning when necessary.

# hyper parameters
* adjust parameter according to data and algorithm.search releated papers to find how those authors do.
* compare results between different sets,such as prediction distribution and affected samples.

# cv
* To build a stable cv dataset,you must understand data and difficulties as better as possible.examine the distribution of validation data is similar to train data.
